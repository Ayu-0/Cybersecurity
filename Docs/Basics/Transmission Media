# Transmission Media : 
Physical path between the transmitter and the receiver that carry data signals between devices, acting as the foundation for communication networks

## Terminology- 
- Segment length – The signal degrades for each type of media after traveling a certain distance to the point where it becomes unintelligible. This distance is referred to as the segment length.
- Attenuation – The loss of signal strength when traveling a distance is called attenuation. Measured in decibels (DB).
Bandwidth – Amount of data that can travel through the cable in a unit period of time. Measure in kbps, Mbps, etc.
- Interference – Each cable is susceptible to certain forms of external noise. This is called EMI (Electromagnetic Interference) or RFI (Radio frequency interference)
- Crosstalk – When a signal carrying conductor is placed near another signal carrying conductor. Interference is generated in the other cable. This is called crosstalk.


# Type of transmission media:

1. Guided Transmission Media -
- You can say it's wired transmission media
- Physical pathways that use cables or wires to transmit data signals from one device to another
- Types: Coaxial Cable, Twisted-Pair Cable, Fiber-optic Cable

## Types of Guided transmission media :

I.) Twisted Pair Cable :
- Twisted pair consists of 8 (paired in group of two) insulated copper wires that are twisted together(colored) in a helical form. 
- This twisting serves a critical purpose: it reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk between adjacent pairs. 
- The twisting pattern creates opposing electromagnetic fields that effectively cancel each other out, substantially reducing the cable's susceptibility to external interference and signal leakage.

Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)
STP incorporates additional metallic shielding to provide enhanced protection against electromagnetic interference. This makes it particularly suitable for industrial environments and areas with high electromagnetic noise levels. It is faster compared to Unshielded Twisted pair

Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
UTP represents the most widely deployed form of twisted pair cabling, particularly in local area network (LAN) environments. It features multiple pairs of twisted copper wires enclosed within a standard plastic jacket without additional shielding. It's less expensice than STP and it's easy to install.
Disadvantages of it -
 Lower capacity
 Not suitable for long distance transmission. 


II.) Coaxial Cable :
The core is made up of copper conductors. Its purpose is the signal transmission. To prevent the copper conductor from overheating, an insulator is utilized. A metal conductor is braided around the insulator. It aids in blocking out any unwanted noise or allowing for any unwanted cross-talk between electrical signals. The setup is entirely covered in a protective plastic layer.
Usually used in broadcast medium ex: cable TV
Segment length of 200m to 500m

*/. Advantages of Coaxial Cable -
It is easier to install.
It has better shielding.
It is capable of transmitting data over longer distances.
Coaxial cables are less affected by noise or cross-talk.

*/. Disadvantages of Coaxial Cable -
Coaxial cables are more expensive than others.
They are less flexible and bulkier.
They must be grounded in order to avoid crosstalk.


III.) Fibre Optics Cable -
Uses the concept total internal reflection of light through a core made up of glass. The core is surrounded by a less dense glass or plastic covering called the coating. It is used for the transmission of large volumes of data. The cable can be unidirectional or bidirectional. It became standard for long-distance communications.

*/. Advantages of Optical Fibre Cable
Increased capacity and bandwidth
Lightweight
Less signal attenuation
Immunity to electromagnetic interference
Resistance to corrosive materials

*/. Disadvantages of Optical Fibre Cable
Difficult to install and maintain
High cost



2. Unguided Transmission Media -
- It's a wireless means of transmission.
- Does not need a physical medium to connect to network nodes or servers.
- Eg., Radio waves, Infrared, microwave 

I.) Radio Means Transmission - 
- Easy to generate and can penetrate through buildings.
- Radio waves have a frequency range of 3 kHz to 300 GHz.
- Lower-frequency radio waves are mainly used for AM radio broadcasting.
- Higher frequency radio waves are used for FM radio broadcasting as well as for satellite communications.

*/. Radio Wave Components:
Transmitter: Responsible for encoding the signal.
Receiver: Responsible for decoding the signal.

Mobile communication
Wireless networking
Radar and navigation

*/. Disadvantages of Radio Waves

II.) Microwaves Transmission -
- Microwave transmission is a method of transmitting data through high-frequency electromagnetic waves over long distances.
- Microwaves generally operate at a frequency range of 1GHz to 300 GHz. Common frequency range is between 3GHz to 30 GHz.
- Microwaves are line-of-sight (LOS) communications means that the transmitting and receiving antennas must be in direct sight of each other.
- Microwaves are Unidirectional.
- The antenna plays a crucial role in microwave transmission, as it converts electrical signals into microwave energy and transmits them through the air.


*/. Types of Microwave Transmission

Terrestrial Microwaves: These microwaves are used for communication purposes, especially between two points on the Earth’s surface. One such example is the communication between two towers or buildings.

Satellite Microwaves: These microwaves are used for communication between the Earth and a satellite in orbit. It is crucial for global communication and broadcasting.


*/. Advanges of Microwave Transmission:
Cheaper than using cables
Freedom from land acquisition
Ease of communication in difficult terrains
Communication over oceans

*/. Disadvanges of Microwave Transmission:
Insecure communication.
Out-of-phase signal.
Susceptible to weather conditions.
Bandwidth is limited.
High cost of design, implementation, and maintenance.


III.) Infrared -
- Used for very short distance communication.
- Cannot penetrate through Objects
- Infrared waves are used to send information between devices that are close to each other.

*/. How it works?
In order to send information with Infrared waves, we need special devices known as transceivers. These devices can send as well as receive infrared light. For infrared communication to work, it is recommended that the two devices that need to communicate with one another should be in sight of each other. In simple words, they need to be facing each other. If not, the light can bounce off a light-colored surface like a ceiling or a wall in order to reach the other device.
