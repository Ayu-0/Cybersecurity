So how internet works :

We'll look at just overview of it, just how things works
Ok so at first we start with physical system to internal mechanism :

So there is 3 types of networks types by which internet is distributed

1. LAN
2. MAN 
3. WAN


1. LAN
So, what is LAN, it is your local area network. A network that connects computers and devices within a limited area like a home, office, or school. Usually owned, controlled and managed by a single organization

2. MAN
Man means Metropolitan area network, Often used by municipalities, universities, or large organizations. Interconnects multiple LANs within a city. These are operated by large Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

3. WAN
Wide area networks: It's where internet begins with, it connects countries, continents with a long very long wire called optical fibre.



But, How Data Actually Flows :

When you request to a website let say google:

Your computer sends a request through your LAN (your home network)
Your router forwards this to your ISP network.
Your ISP routes it through increasingly larger networks.
The request travels through multiple network switches, each figuring out where to send it next
Eventually, it reaches google's server in their data centers
Google's servers process your request and send data back
The data travels back through the same networks in reverse
Your computer receives and displays the webpage

The entire process involves numerous protocols working together, including TCP/IP (how data is packaged and addressed), DNS (translating google.com to an IP address), and HTTP/HTTPS (how web data is formatted).



This is not only sole method to get internet, There is other way by which you can connect to Internet, but it's slow as compared to optical fibres. But it has its own use case, like where optical fibres can't have reach, this way do the job

1. Satellite
2. Wireless technologicies
3. Laser networks


# How data is transmitted over the internet ?

Internet works using TCP/IP (also OSI but not practical) as main protocol -

It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). The Internet protocol suite is the conceptual model and set of communications protocols used on the Internet and similar computer networks. It is commonly known as TCP/IP because the foundational protocols in the suite are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

TCP/IP, is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP can also be used as a communications protocol in a private network (an intranet or an extranet).

There are two IP protocols, TCP and UDP. There are 65335 ports that can be assigned to each. Per IANA, the first 1024 (0â€“1023, so count 0 as a port, too) ports are reserved for specific standardized services. So there are 2048 ports reserved for standardized protocols- 1024 for TCP, 1024 for UDP.

The Internet works by using a protocol called TCP/IP, or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. ... In base terms, TCP/IP allows one computer to talk to another computer via the Internet through compiling packets of data and sending them to right location.


In simple terms :
When we talk about data transfer across the internet, we're actually dealing with two essential requirements for successful communication 

1. Physical data transmission - Can the bits and bytes physically move from point A to point B?
2. Semantic understanding - Can the receiving end interpret the meaning of those bits and bytes?
