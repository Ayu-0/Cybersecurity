# What is Binary Numbers :
- Binary numbers are a fundamental concept in computing, representing data using only two digits: 0 and 1. 
- This base-2 system is crucial for how computers process information.

Binary Numbers and Their Representation
Binary System Basics:

The binary system is a base-2 numeral system, using digits 0 and 1.
Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit, which is 2**020.

### Decimal to Binary Conversion :
A decimal number is converted into a binary number by dividing the given decimal number by 2 continuously until we get the quotient as 1, and we write the numbers from downwards to upwards.


### Conversion of Binary to Decimal :
A binary number is converted into a decimal number by multiplying each digit of the binary number by the power of either 1 or 0 to the corresponding power of 2.
 = 2**n2N, where (nN is the position from the right, starting at 0)

Example: Convert 1011 to decimal
1×2**3+0×2**2+1×2**1+1×2**0=8+0+2+1=11
