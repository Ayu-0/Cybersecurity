## Added sum-up that I made from GPT :

1. 🚫 Missing Resume Device
Common error:
Gave up waiting for suspend/resume device

Happens if /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume refers to a deleted swap

⏱ Adds 10–30s delay

✅ Fix: remove or correct the resume= line and regenerate initramfs:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo sed -i '/^RESUME=/d' /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume
sudo update-initramfs -u
2. 🌀 Plymouth Boot Splash
Just a cosmetic splash screen but can slow down boot, especially with GPU issues

⏱ Adds 5–15s

✅ Fix:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt purge plymouth
sudo update-initramfs -u
3. 📡 Network Wait Services
Services like NetworkManager-wait-online.service can wait for full DHCP, even when you're offline

⏱ Adds 10–15s

✅ Fix:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service
4. 📁 e2scrub_reap.service
Background filesystem checker (mainly for ext4/5)

⏱ Adds 30–45s

✅ Fix:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl disable e2scrub_reap.service
5. 🧱 Heavy Daemons (Apache, MariaDB, PHP, etc.)
Common if you installed LAMP stack, mail server, etc.

Services like:

apache2

mariadb

php-fpm

dovecot, exim4, named, etc.

⏱ Adds 5–30s each

✅ Fix: Disable or remove if not needed:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl disable apache2 mariadb php8.3-fpm
sudo apt purge apache2 mariadb-server php8.3-fpm
6. 🧍 ModemManager / Winbind / Avahi
Background services for modems, Windows networks, mDNS — often unused

⏱ Adds 3–20s

✅ Fix:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl disable ModemManager winbind avahi-daemon
7. 🧠 AppArmor or SELinux
Security frameworks that scan at startup

⏱ Adds 2–5s

✅ Fix (optional):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl disable apparmor
8. 🧷 Unclean Filesystems (fsck)
If any partition was not unmounted properly, it triggers a full disk check

⏱ Adds a lot if you have large or dirty partitions

✅ Fix:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo tune2fs -c 0 -i 0 /dev/sdX
9. 🔃 Mounts That Fail or Hang
If /etc/fstab tries to mount a missing device, USB, or swap

⏱ Adds 30s–90s waiting

✅ Fix: Edit /etc/fstab and comment out problematic lines

10. 🐌 Using HDD (Not SSD)
On an HDD, even a fast system will be bottlenecked by slow I/O

⏱ Adds 10–60s

✅ Fix: Move system to SSD for best boot performance

11. 🔗 GRUB Delay
GRUB timeout too high (default is 5–10s)

✅ Fix: Reduce to 0–1s
Edit /etc/default/grub:

bash
Copy
Edit
GRUB_TIMEOUT=1
sudo update-grub
12. 📜 Heavy Autostart Apps
Apps starting from Openbox’s ~/.config/openbox/autostart file

✅ Fix: Review and trim unnecessary programs
