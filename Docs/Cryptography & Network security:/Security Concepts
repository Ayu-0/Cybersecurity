# Computer and Network security concepts :

## What is cybersecurity - 
- Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks.
- These attacks aim to steal, manipulate, or disrupt services.

## Key Security Goals (CIA Triad)
Confidentiality: Ensuring only authorized users can access data.
Integrity: Ensuring data is not altered in an unauthorized way.
Availability: Ensuring data and services are accessible when needed.

# Types of cyber threats -

1. Malware :
- Also you can say malicious software, a program written to harm user computer system

*/. Common types of malware -
Viruses: Attach themselves to files and spread.
Worms: Self-replicate program that automatically spread to apps and devices without human interaction.
Trojans: Disguised as legitimate software but perform malicious actions.
Ransomware: Encrypts files and demands payment.


2. Social Engineering And Phishing :
- Trick users to reveal information via fraudulent email/messages/phone calls
- Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables
- Common types of attacks -
Spear Phishing: Targeted phishing attack on a specific individual.
Baiting: Leaving infected devices (USBs) for victims to plug in.
Pretexting: Attackers pose as legitimate authority figures to extract information.


3. Man in the middle attack :
- A type of cyber attack where an attacker intercepts and alters communication between two parties.
- Unsecured wifi networks are often happy hunting grounds for hackers looking to launch MITM attacks.

*/. Understand with example -
Imagine you're trying to send a secret message to your friend using a walkie-talkie. You and your friend are communicating on the same frequency, and you're both using the same encryption method to keep your conversation private.

In a Man-in-the-Middle attack, an attacker (the "man in the middle") intercepts your message and alters it before it reaches your friend. The attacker can do this by:

Eavesdropping on your conversation: The attacker listens in on your conversation, capturing the encrypted message.
Modifying the message: The attacker alters the message, perhaps injecting malware or stealing sensitive information.
Forwarding the modified message: The attacker sends the modified message to your friend, making it seem like it came from you.


4. Denial Of Service Attack :
- In a DOS attack, an attacker sends a large amount of traffic to a website, server, or network, making it too slow to use or entirely unavailable to legitimate users. 
- A distributed denial-of-service attack, or DDoS attack, is similar, except it uses a network of internet-connected, malware-infected devices or bots, which are known as a botnet, to cripple or crash the target system. 


5. Zero day exploits :
- It's a type of cyberattack that takes advantage of unpatched security flaw in computer software, hardware, or firmware. 
- “Zero day” refers to the fact that a software or device vendor has “zero days”—or no time


6. Password Attacks :
- They try to guess or steal the password.
- or, they can use brute force attacks to steal passwords, repeatedly trying different password combinations until one is successful.


7. Injection Attacks :
- In these attacks, hackers inject malicious code into a program or download malware to execute remote commands, enabling them to read or modify a database or change website data.
- Two common type of injection attacks -

SQL injection attacks: when hackers exploit the SQL syntax to spoof identity: expose, tamper, destroy or make existing data unavailable or become the database server administrator.
Cross-site scripting (XSS): these types of attacks are similar to SQL injection attacks, except instead of extracting data from a database, they typically infect users who visit a website.
