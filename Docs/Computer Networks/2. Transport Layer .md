# Transport Layer :

- It ensures that data sent from one computer reaches the correct application on another computer reliably or quickly (TCP or UDP)
- From one network to another network, data transferred by network Layer, the actual transportation from one computer to another but  within the computer transportation of data from network to application or application to network is done by transport layer.
- The data actually moves from higher layers down to lower layers on the sending side, then up from lower layers to higher layers on the receiving side.
- In the transport layer, data transmission is identified using sockets, which consist of an IP address and port number. Each application creates a socket when sending data from the application layer to the transport layer, a process called multiplexing. On the receiving end, data moves from the network layer to the transport layer, which checks the socket information and directs it to the appropriate application, known as demultiplexing.
- Sockets have unique  identifiers, and that each segment have special fields that indicate the socket to which the segment is to be delivered. These special fields, are the source port number field and the destination port number field


## Why Do We Need the Transport Layer?
Imagine you are using your laptop connected to the internet, and you open multiple applications:

YouTube (streaming video)
WhatsApp (chat messaging)
Google Chrome (web browsing)
All these applications need to send and receive data at the same time. But how does your computer know which data belongs to which application?

The Transport Layer solves this problem by:
✔ Identifying different applications using port numbers.
✔ Splitting large data into smaller chunks (segmentation) for transmission.
✔ Ensuring data arrives correctly and in order (in TCP-based applications).

## How the Transport Layer Works ?
A. Process-to-Process Communication (Using Ports)
Each running application has a unique port number to distinguish it from others.

Application	    Protocol	Default Port
Web (HTTP)	    TCP	         80
Email (SMTP)	  TCP	         25
FTP	            TCP	         21
Streaming   	  UDP	Dynamic (e.g, 5004)
Online Gaming	  UDP	Dynamic (e.g, 27015)

For example, if you watch a YouTube video while sending an email, the transport layer ensures:
Video packets go to YouTube's video player (UDP, Port 5004).
Email packets go to Gmail’s mail server (SMTP, Port 25).
This prevents your video stream from mixing with your email.

B. Segmentation and Reassembly
Large files, such as videos or documents, cannot be sent as a single unit. The Transport Layer splits them into smaller segments before transmission.

Example: Sending a 10 MB file via TCP
📌 Segmentation: The file is broken into smaller 1 KB chunks (segments).
📌 Transmission: Each chunk is sent with a sequence number to ensure correct order.
📌 Reassembly: The receiver recombines the chunks in the correct order.

What if a chunk is lost?
✔ TCP detects the missing segment and requests a retransmission.


## Main Protocols of the Transport Layer
The transport layer operates primarily through two protocols:

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) → Reliable, ordered delivery.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) → Fast but unreliable delivery.
Feature	                TCP	                                                           UDP
Connection-type	        Connection-Oriented	                                           Connectionless
Reliability	            Ensures all packets arrive in order	                           No guarantee of delivery
Flow Control	          Prevents sender from overwhelming receiver	                   No flow control
Congestion Control	    Avoids overloading the network	                               No congestion control
Speed	                  Slower due to reliability checks	                             Faster, used in real-time applications
Examples            	  (HTTP, HTTPS),(SMTP), (FTP)	                                   Online gaming,streaming, VoIP calls

A.) TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) -
TCP is used when reliability is important, like sending emails, loading web pages, or downloading files.

/* How TCP works:

i) Connection Establishment (Three-Way Handshake): Before sending data, TCP establishes a connection:
1️⃣ Client (Sender) sends SYN(SYN is short for "synchronize" and it represents the first message in TCP's three-way handshake process)
"Hey, I want to talk!"
2️⃣ Server replies with SYN-ACK (Synchronize + Acknowledge)
"Okay, I'm ready. Let’s start!"
3️⃣ Client sends ACK (Acknowledge) (ACK used to confirm that the data is recieved)
"Great, let’s go!"
Now, the connection is established, and data can be transferred.

ii) Reliable Data Transmission
TCP ensures all packets arrive correctly:
✔ If a packet is lost, the receiver asks for retransmission.
✔ Packets are reassembled in the correct order using sequence numbers.
Eg., Downloading a file via FTP (TCP)
Your computer requests a file (TCP SYN).
The server starts sending the file in small chunks (segments).
Each chunk is acknowledged (ACK packets) before the next is sent.
If a chunk is lost, it is retransmitted.
-> ACK packets - data packet sent in a network communication to signal that another packet has been received 

iii) Connection Termination (Four-Way Handshake)
Once data transfer is complete, TCP gracefully closes the connection:
1️⃣ Client sends FIN (Finish) → "I’m done sending."
2️⃣ Server replies with ACK → "Okay, noted."
3️⃣ Server sends FIN → "I’m done too."
4️⃣ Client replies with ACK → "Goodbye!"

### Here's how TCP acknowledges packets :

 Sequence Numbers: TCP assigns a unique sequence number to each byte of data sent. These sequence numbers help the receiver reorder data correctly and detect missing segments. Each TCP segment includes a sequence number that indicates the position of the first byte in that segment within the overall data stream.

 ACKnowledgment Numbers: The receiver sends ACK packets back to the sender, indicating the next expected byte. The acknowledgment number in the TCP header acknowledges all data up to (but not including) that sequence number. This means the receiver has received all previous bytes in order without any gaps.

 Selective ACKnowledgment (SACK): If the receiver detects missing or out-of-order packets, it can use the SACK option to tell the sender which segments have been received successfully and which are missing. This allows the sender to retransmit only the missing data instead of resending everything after a packet loss, improving efficiency.

 Cumulative ACKnowledgment: In addition to selective acknowledgment, TCP also uses cumulative acknowledgment, meaning the receiver only acknowledges the highest contiguous sequence number received in order.
  - If the receiver receives packets 1, 2, 4, and 5, it will send ACK = 3, meaning it is still waiting for packet 3 before acknowledging anything beyond it.
  - The sender will keep receiving duplicate ACKs (ACK = 3) until it retransmits packet 3.
  - Once packet 3 is received, the receiver will acknowledge the next expected byte (ACK = 6) since it now has packets 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in order.



B.) UDP (User Datagram Protocol) - Fast but Unreliable
UDP is used when speed is more important than accuracy, like video streaming, VoIP calls, and online gaming.

/* How UDP works:
✔ No connection setup (No handshake) → Just sends data immediately.
✔ No error checking → If a packet is lost, it is ignored.

Eg., Online Gaming (Call of Duty, FIFA, etc.)
UDP sends game movements instantly.
If a packet is lost, it’s ignored (the game keeps going).
TCP would be too slow because retransmissions would cause lag.

### Congesation control -
- It prevents the overflow of packets in a network by managing the amount of data sent into the network.
- When network overwhelms with too much data exceeding the network's capacity to handle it, causing bottlenecks, leads to network congestion, packet loss, and degraded performance.
- When TCP connection established, sender doesn't overwhelm the network, it start slow and adjust acc. to network bandwidth

- Congestion-avoidance mechanisms kick in when the network detects packet loss because TCP assumes that packet loss is a sign of network congestion. 
- There are two ways in which TCP assumes that packets are getting lost:
i. When there is a timeout
ii. When the server receives duplicate ACKs for a data packet

*/. Congesation Control Algorithms -

I.) Leaky Bucket Algorithm : 
- Based on an analogy of how a bucket with a constant leak will overflow if, either the average rate at which water is poured in exceeds the rate at which the bucket leaks. or if more water than the capacity of the bucket is poured in all at once. 
- The leaky bucket algorithm is a method of congestion control where multiple packets are stored temporarily. These packets are sent to the network at a constant rate that is decided between the sender and the network. This algorithm is used to implement congestion control through traffic shaping in data networks.

?. How it works -
-  Consider a scenario where data traffic arrives at varying rates, such as 10 Mbps, 15 Mbps, or even 0 Mbps at different times. This inconsistent traffic rate is called bursty traffic.
- When the sender wants to transmit packets, the packets are thrown into the bucket. These packets get accumulated in the bucket present at the network interface.
- If the bucket is full, the packets are discarded by the buckets.
- This bucket will leak at a constant rate. This means that the packets will be transmitted to the network at a constant rate. This constant rate is known as the Leak Rate or the Average Rate.
- In this way, bursty traffic is converted into smooth, fixed traffic by the leaky bucket.
- Queuing and releasing the packets at different intervals help in reducing network congestion and increasing overall performance.

*/. Disadvantages -
The output is uniform only if the bucket is non-empty. In case the bucket is empty or there is some packet loss, then the output can contain gaps.
The packets are transferred only on ticks. If the packet size is large, then the queue gets filled up quickly as the effective transmission rate is low. This can lead to packet loss as the queue is of finite size.


II.) Token Bucket Algorithm :
- Imagine a bucket that can hold a certain number of tokens(unit of bytes or single packet). Tokens are added to the bucket at a fixed rate, representing the allowed bandwidth
- In some applications, when large bursts arrive, the output is allowed to speed up. This calls for a more flexible algorithm, preferably one that never loses information. Therefore, a token bucket algorithm finds its uses in network traffic shaping or rate-limiting.
- The core idea is - One bucket, steady token generation, ability to handle bursts within the bucket's token capacity
- Tokens accumulate in a bucket at a defined rate, and every operation consumes a token. If the bucket is empty, further operations must wait until more tokens are added


### Timers -
- TCP uses timers to ensure that it doesn't delay data transmission 
- It can detect failed connections, resends packets if no response and hold connection for delayed packets.
- TCP implementation uses four timers – 

I.) Retransmission Timers:  
- When TCP sends a segment the timer starts and stops when the acknowledgment is received. 
- Tracks packet ACKs, triggers resend if no ACK received by timeout.
- Retransmission Timeout/RTO is the time TCP waits for an ACK before retransmitting a segment. It is calculated based on the Round Trip Time (RTT), which is the time taken for a segment to travel from the sender to the receiver and back as an ACK.
- RTT three types -
i.) Measured RTT (RTTm): The time taken for a segment(unit data) to reach its destination and be acknowledged.

ii.) Smoothed RTT (RTTs): It weighted average of RTTm.
Initially -> No value
After the first measurement -> RTTs=RTTm
After each measurement -> RTTs= (1-t)*RTTs + t*RTTm
Note: t=1/8 (default if not given)

iii.) Deviation RTT (RTTd): Measures the variability of RTT to adjust RTO dynamically. 
Initially -> No value
After the first measurement -> RTTd=RTTm/2
After each measurement -> RTTd= (1-k)*RTTd + k*(RTTm-RTTs)
Note: k=1/4 (default if not given)

- The Retransmission Timeout (RTO) in TCP is calculated by adding 4 times the RTT deviation to the smoothed RTT. The formula is: 
  RTO = Smoothed RTT + 4 * Deviation RTT

?. How it handle Multiple Retransmissions:
- If a segment is retransmitted and still no ACK is received, TCP may double the RTO for subsequent retransmissions, up to a maximum limit to prevent infinite waiting.

- TCP uses a default RTO, typically around 3 seconds, If the connection is lost entirely, TCP will eventually terminate the connection


II.) Persistent Timer :
- Used to deal with the "zero-window-size deadlock" where the sender has data to send, but the receiver has advertised a zero-sized window, effectively stopping data transmission
- When a TCP sender receives an ACK from the receiver with a zero-sized window, it means the receiver's buffer is full, and it can't accept any more data. 
- The sender starts the persistent timer to prevent a deadlock situation where the sender is indefinitely blocked from sending data. 
- When the persistent timer expires, the sender sends a special segment called a "probe" segment to the receiver. This probe segment contains a small amount of data (typically 1 byte) and is not acknowledged by the receiver. 
- The receiver, upon receiving the probe, responds with an updated window size in its ACK
- TCP window probe means that the receiver has reduced his receive buffer (a.k.a. window) to zero, basically telling the sender to stop sending 

III.) Keep-Alive-Timer :
- It periodically checks if a connection is still active by sending small packets to the remote end to ensure the connection remains open and to detect if the connection has become unresponsive.
- Each time the server hears from a client, it resets this timer. The time-out is usually 2 hours
- If the server does not hear from the client after 2 hours, it sends a probe segment. If there is no response after 10 probes, each of which is 75 s apart, it assumes that the client is down and terminates the connection.

IV.) Time-Wait Timer :
- After a TCP connection is closed, the sockets remain in the TIME-WAIT state for a specific duration (typically 60 seconds) to ensure that any remaining packets in transit are received and acknowledged

?. Why it's needed -
It's possible for datagrams that are still making their way through the network to attempt to access the closed port, so the TIME-WAIT state helps prevent these packets from being misinterpreted or causing problems
The timer prevents immediate reuse of the same socket pair, avoiding confusion between old and new connections. After 2MSL, the socket becomes available for reuse without risk of data corruption.



### Checksums -
- 16-bit field in the TCP header used for error detection by verifying the integrity of the data, including the TCP header, data, and a pseudo-header, during transmission
- Checksum helps in providing a simple way in verifing that data hasn’t been corrupted
- 

### Flow Control 
- It's a mechanism in TCP protocol to control excess data traffic to a network.
- TCP uses a sliding window for flow control
- It ensures the sender doesn't overwhelm the receiver by sending data faster than it can handle

*/. Sliding Window Protocol -
- It's a technique for controlling the flow of data between two devices.
- The TCP sliding window determines the number of unacknowledged bytes, x, that one system can send to another. Two factors determine the value of x:
i.) The size of the send buffer on the sending system
ii.) The size and available space in the receive buffer on the receiving system

Window Size - Indicates the amount of data (in bytes) the receiver is willing to accept at any given time.

?. What's going on here 
- TCP on the sending system must wait to send more data until all bytes in the current send buffer are acknowledged by TCP on the receiving system
- On the receiving system, TCP stores received data in a receive buffer.
- If the receive buffer is full, the receiving system advertises a receive window size of zero, and the sending system must wait to send more data
- The available space in the receive buffer depends on how quickly data is read from the buffer by the receiving application.
