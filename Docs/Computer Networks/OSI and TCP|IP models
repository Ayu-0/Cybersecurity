# OSI AND TCP/IP MODELS -

Basically it's a internet protocol suite, it's a framework that organizes the protocols used for communication on the internet. You can say it's a main protocol.

OSI : Open source interconneted models ( conceptual framework )
TCP/IP : Foundation of Internet communications and is more practical compared to the OSI model

OSI model Layers : 
1. Application - Provides an interface for the end-user
2. Presentation - Transaltes data from computer code into network-formatted code
3. Session - Establishes request/response interaction between two network hosts
4. Transport - Manager traffic flow through the network layer
5. Network  - Determines what path data packets will be taking to get from one network to another
6. Data Link- Breaks data into frames that will be transmitted over a physical layer
7. Physical - Converts digital data into optical, electrical or radio signals


TCP/IP Model Layers :
1. Application
2. Transport
3. Network
4. Data-Link
5. Physical



1. Application layer : 

 - It does directly interact with user applications and network services.
 - It ensure that data is correctly formatted and routed
 - It ensure proper communication between devices using protocols

Network Services - Network service is an application running at the network application layer and above, that provides data storage, manipulation, presentation, communication or other capability which is often implemented using a clientâ€“server or peer-to-peer architecture 

Client-Server Architecture - In client-server architecture, client requests service and server provides that service

Peer-to-peer - In which each device acts as both, as a server and a client.


* Common protocols used in application layer -

 1. HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol
