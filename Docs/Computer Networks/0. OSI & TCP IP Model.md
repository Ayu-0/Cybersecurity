# OSI AND TCP/IP MODELS -

Basically it's a internet protocol suite, it's a framework that organizes the protocols used for communication on the internet. You can say it's a main protocol.

**OSI : Open source interconneted models ( conceptual framework )**

**TCP/IP : Foundation of Internet communications and is more practical compared to the OSI model**

### OSI model Layers : 

1. Application - Provides an interface for the end-user
2. Presentation - Transaltes data from computer code into network-formatted code
3. Session - Establishes request/response interaction between two network hosts
4. Transport - Manager traffic flow through the network layer
5. Network  - Determines what path data packets will be taking to get from one network to another
6. Data Link- Breaks data into frames that will be transmitted over a physical layer
7. Physical - Converts digital data into optical, electrical or radio signals


### TCP/IP Model Layers :

1. Application
2. Transport
3. Network
4. Data-Link
5. Physical
